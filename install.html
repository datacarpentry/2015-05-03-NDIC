<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, 
  you will need working copies of the software described below.
  Please make sure to install everything
  (or at least to download the installers)
  <em>before</em> the start of your bootcamp. 
  
Participants should bring and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.
